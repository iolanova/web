                        As friends and as a team, we have a dream of sharing our passions with others through projects such as developing apps!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        There are so many things that motivate us to develop apps:
                        <br>
                        - We enjoy the process and the result!
                        <br>
                        - We want to offer users an appealing design! 
                        <br>
                        - We love cool visual feedback when using the app(s)!
                        <br>
                        - We want to share our experiences and knowledge in the relevant areas!
                        <br>
                        - We love designing every step of the process, from the initial idea to the finished project, and not just being “a small part of the machine”!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Out of interest and in the hope of inspiring many people with our projects, we want to continue developing ourselves and not just the app(s) in the future!
