                        As friends and as a team, we have a dream of sharing our passions with others through projects such as developing apps!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        There are so many things that motivate us to develop apps:
                        <br>
                        - We enjoy the process and the result!
                        <br>
                        - We want to offer users an appealing design! 
                        <br>
                        - We love cool visual feedback when using the app(s)!
                        <br>
                        - We want to share our experiences and knowledge in the relevant areas!
                        <br>
                        - We love designing every step of the process, from the initial idea to the finished project, and not just being “a small part of the machine”!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Out of interest and in the hope of inspiring many people with our projects, we want to continue developing ourselves and not just the app(s) in the future!

                    <p> <strong>How do I play the game?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    Each game starts with the selection of a theme. To do this, first select the level you want to play at: Rookie, Pro, or Expert.
                    <br>
                    At the top of the page, you will find the initial economic event. At the bottom, you will find five pre-set answer options, three of which are correct and two of which are incorrect. If you have no idea which answer might be correct, tap on the image in the middle. Contextual help will appear here.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong>How do I change my goal?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    The default target is ten points. Each correct answer triggers a new economic event. If you correctly identify ten effects and connections, you win the game.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong>Can I save my scores?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    Yes. Using the “Save score” button, you can decide for yourself whether your progress and results are included in the game history.
                    <br>
                    Quick note: Your results belong to you! Your personal data, progress, and successes (or failures) will not be collected or shared with third parties.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> <strong>Can I delete my entire gaming history?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    Yes. If you want to delete your game history, you can do so using the button at the bottom of the settings page.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong>Do I have to reset all the settings every time I want to play?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    No. All your individual settings are saved so that you can continue playing right away the next time you start the game.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p> <strong>Change the exam mode</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    The exam mode controls the option of going back one (or more) steps in the chain of events. However, the answer options are always rearranged. If you activate this mode, this option disappears. However, this does not apply to clicking on a wrong answer. In this case, you simply start a new game.
                    <br>
                    This setting can be adjusted individually for each level. The settings are applied immediately upon returning to the game.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong>Change the ratio of correct and incorrect answers</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    Using the slider, you can adjust settings for the number of answers displayed from four to six and the number of incorrect answers from one to three.
                    <br>
                    If you reduce the number of possible answers and maximize the number of incorrect answers at the same time, the game becomes more difficult.
                    <br>
                    If you set the number of possible answers to six and reduce the number of incorrect answers to one, the probability of choosing the correct answer is highest, making the game easier.
                    <br>
                    These settings will be applied immediately when you return to the game.
